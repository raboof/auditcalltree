= Introduction =

With Linux getting ever more advanced and complicated, it can be hard to 
figure out which application is accessing a given file.

== auditd ==

Enter the linux 'audit' infrastructure: this package contains an 'auditd' to 
do the actual auditing and some tools to specify which events must be audited:

  http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/audit/index.html

== auditd limitations ==

Unfortunately, the information provided by auditd is rather sparse. For 
example, it does log which process triggered the audit event, but this 
might be a generic tool like 'mv' called from some script or application.

== what is auditcalltree? ==

Fortunately, the auditd infrastructure allows us to easily plug in other
dispatchers. 

auditcalltree is a smple dispatcher that writes audit events to syslog, 
including the process hierarchy leading up to the process performing the 
audited action.

= Compiling =

make auditcalltree

= Configuration =

Edit /etc/audit/auditd.conf, and point 'dispatcher' to the auditcalltree 
script.

Restart auditd.

= Example =

As an example, I added 'write' auditing to /etc/resolv.conf, and 'touched' 
this file from a bash shell in a screen session:
